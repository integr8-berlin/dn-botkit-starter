### About botkit-starter-web:

#### Customizable web-based chat client

Botkit Anywhere includes an easy to customize chat client that can be used as a full-screen web app, built into the structure
of an existing page, or embedded in an entire site with an iframe.

The built-in client uses websocket connections to establish a real time connection
to your Botkit app in order to instantly send and receive messages. It supports bot-friendly
features like quick replies and image attachments. It gracefully handles failed connections
and reconnects.

The chat client is built with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
Developers can customize the look and feel of the client by modifying the included markup and CSS.
New chat features such as custom cards or actions can be added with just a little bit of code.

#### Chat Server and API

Botkit Anywhere's built-in chat server can handle thousands of simultaneous one-on-one conversations with your users.
The chat server provides both a websocket and a webhook based interface for sending and receiving messages.
It is a great solution for including one-on-one chat in a web site or native app.

Additionally, Botkit Anywhere includes APIs for retrieving a user's conversation history,
and account-linking features that enable you to identify existing users to your bot.
